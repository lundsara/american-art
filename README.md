# American Art Afficianado Trivia


This is a trivia game that gives players an image of a work of art and they have to correctly attribute the work to an artist from a four multiple choice options. The correct answers are tallied against the total and the final results are given at the end of the quiz. I am making this game because I love American art history and wanted to create a very visual game that I would be interested in playing myself!
